Two markers are positioned on the table outside of the container, one blue and one black with a small, red bottom portion. At the center of the table lies a large, white spiral sketchpad with the term 'SEO' written largely in the middle of the page in black ink within a blue cloud with black outlining. The page of the notepad also has the terms 'BACKLINK,' 'CONTENT,' HEADINGS,' MOBILE COMPATIBILITY,' 'SOCIAL MEDIA,' and 'LINK BUILDING' written with corresponding artwork drawn beneath or above them. The phrases form an orb around the SEO artwork." />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

The screen of the laptop shows a multi-colored bar graph, pie charts and three percentages (50%, 20% and 10%), all of which are layed out on one document and labeled 'Reputation.'" />
            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly
                to your website.
